<pre><code>npm install doctrine</code></pre>

<p>simple example:</p>

<pre><code>doctrine.parse(
    [
        "/**",
        " * This function commet is parsed by doctrine",
        " * @param {{ok:String}} userName",
        "*/"
    ].join('\n'), { unwrap: true });
</code></pre>

<p>and gets following information</p>

<pre><code>{
    "description": "This function commet is parsed by doctrine",
    "tags": [
        {
            "title": "param",
            "description": null,
            "type": {
                "type": "RecordType",
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "type": "FieldType",
                        "key": "ok",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "NameExpression",
                            "name": "String"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
            "name": "userName"
        }
